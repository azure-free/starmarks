** Because not all bookmarks are created equal **

Starmarks is for anyone who feels like one star isn't enough to say how much you love your bookmarks.  Smartmarks makes it possible to rate bookmarks with 5 stars and track which bookmarks you use the most.  Organize your favorite spots on the web with pression and never worry about losing a great bookmark again!

** Why Starmarks
```
If you bookmark a lot of websites it's easy for them to get lost.  Each one may seem special at the time you save it but when every bookmark's special, none of them are.

There needs to be a way to see which bookmarks you like best and visit the most.   Not a big pile you have to sort through to find the good ones.

```
Starmarks let's you bookmark freely.  Save those 'gotta have' websites right along with those 'possibly useful' ones without worrying about them getting mixed up or forgotten.

Save your bookmarks with a star rating from 1 to 5.  Then look them up later by star count, last visited, or times visited.
